### [Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5)  

HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.  

hese tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.  

```<a>``` element = anchor element  

### [Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-css)  

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and many other aspects of HTML elements.

#### CSS Selectors

- id
- class
- [attr=value] (e.g. [type='radio'])

#### Absolute versus Relative Units

_Absolute_  
- in
- mm

_Relative_  
- em
- rem

#### Represent colors in CSS

[RGB color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model)  

**Hed Code**  

In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components  

_black:_  
```
color: #000000;
```

white:_  
```
color: #FFFFFF;
```

_red:_ 
```
color: #FF0000;
```

_green:_ 
```
color: #00FF00;
```

_blue:_ 
```
color: #0000FF;
```

**_Abbreviated Hex Code_**  

For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.  
This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.  

Short Hex Code  

_red:_ 
```
color: #F00;
```

_green:_ 
```
color: #0F0;
```

_blue:_ 
```
color: #00F;
```

_cyan:_ 
```
color: #0FF;
```

**RGB values**  

_black:_  
```
color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
```

white:_  
```
color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
```

_red:_ 
```
color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
```

_green:_ 
```
color: rgb(0, 255, 0);
```

_blue:_ 
```
color: rgb(0, 0, 255);
```

#### CSS Variables

```
<style>
    :root {
        --p-color: purple;
    }
</style>
```

### Applied Visual Design

- Use the ```<u>``` Tag to Underline Text

- Use the ```<em>``` Tag to Italicize Text

- Use the ```<s>``` Tag to Strikethrough Text

- Use the ```<hr>``` Tag to Create a Horizontal Line

**rgba()**

The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear.  

**_rgba stands for:_**  
r = red  
g = green  
b = blue  
a = alpha/level of opacity  

_example:_  
```
background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1)
```
**opacity:**  

A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.  
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.  
A value of 0 is completely transparent.  

**text-transform:**  
Value | Result
--- | ---
lowercase | "transform me"
uppercase | "TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize | "Transform Me"
initial | Use the default value
inherit | Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none | Default: Use the original text

**pseudo-class selector**  

:hover  

**CSS Box Model**  

**_Block-level_** items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while **_inline_** items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans).  

The default layout of elements in this way is called the **_normal flow_** of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.  

**relative**  
allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page.  

**absolute**  
locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. 
One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
